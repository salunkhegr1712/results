Sure! Here’s a more conversational version:

### Completed
1. **Mastering Key Components**:
    - I've delved into Data Lake components like syncop, calculator, loader, and normalization. I’ve also worked on the Overshoot component, implementing the materiality threshold functionality. 
    - Along the way, I’ve picked up skills in Spark3, Java, Kafka, Kubernetes, SQL, and No-SQL databases.
    - I also learned about various types of limits and their significance during the Datalake Limit Integration project.

2. **Adopting Best Practices**:
    - I’ve implemented Test-Driven Development (TDD) to ensure our code is robust and follows best practices.
    - Meeting deadlines has been a priority, and I’m proud that our releases have been timely and stable in production.
    - I participated in the YG hackathon and attended technical sessions within CCR, which provided valuable insights.

3. **Team Collaboration**:
    - Building strong relationships with my team and tribe has been crucial. This collaborative environment has greatly enhanced my technical and business understanding.
    - By following JIRA practices, we’ve improved our productivity and alignment with agile processes.

### In Progress
1. **Ongoing Learning**:
    - I’m currently working on gaining a deeper understanding of the OPAL Extraction API and its implementation.
    - I’m also starting to integrate Business-Driven Development (BDD) practices in our projects.

2. **Skill Enhancement**:
    - Upskilling in Azure cloud fundamentals and CCR DL landscape is a continuous journey for me.

3. **Innovation and Improvement**:
    - I’m actively looking for ways to improve our performance and bring innovative ideas to the team.

### To Be Done in Future
1. **OPAL Extraction API Project**:
    - I aim to lead a full-fledged project related to the OPAL Extraction API, applying my growing knowledge in this area.

2. **Advanced BDD Practices**:
    - Implementing BDD practices more extensively in our projects is on my to-do list.

3. **Further Upskilling and Certifications**:
    - I plan to pursue more training and certifications to deepen my expertise in Azure cloud and other emerging technologies.
    - I’m excited to attend more technical sessions, guilds, and hackathons to stay updated and contribute to our innovation culture.
